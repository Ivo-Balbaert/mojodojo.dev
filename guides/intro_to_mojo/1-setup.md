# Intro to Mojo
_This is in very early stages and under heavy development_

This assumes some familiarity with a programming language like Python, but does not assume knowledge about Computer Science (CS). While it aims to be a stepping stone from Python to Mojo, unique Python concepts will be explained along the way for programmers from all backgrounds. Anything that explains CS fundamentals will be in a green box so you can skip over them if you already come from a systems programming background:

::: tip CS Fundamentals
This is related to a Computer Science topic that you'll need to be familiar with to understand how Mojo works at a much deeper level.
