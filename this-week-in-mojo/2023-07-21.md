# This Week in Mojo 2023-07-21

## Official Content

- New section added to the roadmap document [overall priorities](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/roadmap.html#overall-priorities):

### Overall Priorities
Mojo is still in early development and many language features will arrive in the coming months. We are highly focused on building Mojo the right way (for the long-term), so we want to fully build-out the core Mojo language features before we work on other dependent features and enhancements.

Currently, that means we are focused on the core system programming features that are essential to Mojo‚Äôs mission, and as outlined in the following sections of this roadmap.

In the near-term, we will not prioritize ‚Äúgeneral goodness‚Äù work such as:
- Adding syntactic sugar and short-hands for Python.
- Adding features from other languages that are missing from Python (such as public/private declarations).
- Tackling broad Python ecosystem challenges like packaging.

If you have encountered any bugs with current Mojo behavior, please submit an issue on GitHub.

If you have ideas about how to improve the core Mojo features, we prefer that you first look for similar topics or start a new conversation about it in our GitHub Discussions.

We also consider Mojo to be a new member of the Python family, so if you have suggestions to improve the experience with Python, we encourage you to propose these ‚Äúgeneral goodness‚Äù enhancements through the formal PEP process.

### Top level code in REPL and Jupyter 
The default right now is in a bit of a weird place, Mojo top-level code behaves differently than anything else. It is "strict" by default, however the problem right now is that top-level Mojo code is neither "static" in the `fn` sense or "dynamic" in the `def` sense. The goal is to make it behave like an imperative body of code.

### Only allowing `fn` in `struct`
I can see how this might avoid some accidental use of dynamic behavior, but I'm not sure why that is something we're worried about. Further, there are other issues - we need to support top level code and other things that aren't tied to an `fn` keyword. Furthermore, we want constrained dynamic classes as well (Jeff will share a doc hopefully ~this week about this) in Mojo that aren't as dynamic as Python's.

At the end of the day, we also want `fn` and `def` to be friends and get along and allow intermixing. This is a pretty important design principle - we don't want "fn to be mojo" and "def to be legacy python code", so I see this approach working...

### Renaming Mojo to Python++
Just to set expectations here, we don't plan to rename Mojo - we quite like the name üòÄ. I agree with you that Python++ is a useful working model to think about some of Mojo's goals though!

### Vales region borrow checker
Yep, I've followed it. It is currently experimental and adds non-trivial overhead to the runtime of a program, so it will be interesting to see how it bakes out and matures in Vale. For Mojo, we're sticking with somewhat more traditional implementation approaches.

This isn't to say "no, we will never do this": we need to get more experience with the planned lifetimes and other features, and if they don't work then we'd consider it. That said, I can say that "it isn't on our radar and it looks like there is more research to be done before we'd seriously consider it".
