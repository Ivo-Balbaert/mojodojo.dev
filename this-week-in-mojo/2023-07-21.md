# This Week in Mojo 2023-07-21

## Official Content

- New section added to the roadmap document [overall priorities](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/roadmap.html#overall-priorities):

### Overall Priorities
Mojo is still in early development and many language features will arrive in the coming months. We are highly focused on building Mojo the right way (for the long-term), so we want to fully build-out the core Mojo language features before we work on other dependent features and enhancements.

Currently, that means we are focused on the core system programming features that are essential to Mojo’s mission, and as outlined in the following sections of this roadmap.

In the near-term, we will not prioritize “general goodness” work such as:
- Adding syntactic sugar and short-hands for Python.
- Adding features from other languages that are missing from Python (such as public/private declarations).
- Tackling broad Python ecosystem challenges like packaging.

If you have encountered any bugs with current Mojo behavior, please submit an issue on GitHub.

If you have ideas about how to improve the core Mojo features, we prefer that you first look for similar topics or start a new conversation about it in our GitHub Discussions.

We also consider Mojo to be a new member of the Python family, so if you have suggestions to improve the experience with Python, we encourage you to propose these “general goodness” enhancements through the formal PEP process.
