### Python PEP 703 - Optional Global Interpreter Lock
It should be strictly compatible with Mojo's use of CPython and I think it is a good move for the Python ecosystem in general. I'm seeing a lot of folks that seem to be declaring success early, my read of PEP703 is that there is still a lot of work to do to figure things out and land things. The [Python core team summary](https://discuss.python.org/t/a-steering-council-notice-about-pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-in-cpython/30474) is really great and I highly recommend reading it. It seems like the transition will take a few years. I'm personally very curious how heavy users of CPython internals (e.g. TensorFlow and PyTorch) will handle the transition - the changes are pretty profound, breaking core C APIs like `PyList_GetItem`.

Also my read of the code in the implementation seems that they may need to iterate a bit. One of the core operations in the critical path for performance is `_Py_ThreadId` and my read of it is that it will break code that uses thread local storage for other things by directly scribbling into it in a [very low-level way](https://github.com/colesbury/nogil/blob/f7e45d6bfbbd48c8d5cf851c116b73b85add9fc6/Include/object.h#L428-L455)

That said, there are a ton of crazy smart people working on this and everyone seems highly motivated. Overall, it's a great step forward for the ecosystem in any case in my opinion.
