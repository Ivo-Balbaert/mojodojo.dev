# This Week in Mojo 2023-07-07
_week in progress_

## Playground Update
[Full Changelog Here](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/changelog.html#july-2023)

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Tuple expressions now work without parentheses. For example `a, b = b, a` works as you‚Äôd expect in Python.
- Chained assigments `a = b = 42` and the walrus operator `some_function(b := 17)` are now supported.

### ü¶ã Changed

- The `simd_width` and `dtype_simd_width` functions in the TargetInfo module have been renamed to `simdwidthof`.

- The `dtype_` prefix has been dropped from `alignof`, `sizeof`, and `bitwidthof`. You can now use these functions with any argument type, including `DType`.

- The `inf`, `neginf`, `nan`, `isinf`, `isfinite`, and `isnan` functions were moved from the Numerics module to the Math module, to better align with Python‚Äôs library structure.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [Issue #253](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/253) Issue when accessing a struct member alias without providing parameters.

- [Issue #404](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/404): The docs now use snake_case for variable names, which more closely conforms to Python‚Äôs style.

- [Issue #379](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/379): Tuple limitations have been addressed and multiple return values are now supported, even without parentheses.

- [Issue #347](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/347): Tuples no longer require parentheses.

- [Issue #320](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/320): Python objects are now traversable via for loops.



## Mojo Team Answers

### Init uninitialized objects in `fn`
This is effectively how the Mojo compiler works internally, and we fudge a couple of things for sake of simplicity of model. For example, the `self` member of a `__del__` destructor is a reference, but it is "magic" in that it is required to be live-in and uninit-out. The self for a memory-only `__init__` has the opposite polarity, being uninit on entry and init on exit.

### Multiple Moves with `^`
The `^` operator kills a lifetime or invokes the stealing moveinit, producing a new owned RValue, so `^^^` is just repeatedly moving üôÇ. It is probably a noop in the implementation because we do move elision, I haven't checked though.

### Docs Internationalization
We have no plans to translate our content at this time or in the near future. Our products and documentation are still in their infancy and there's a long way to go before curated translation becomes a priority.

### String UInt8 implementation
It makes sense to use `UInt8` instead of `Int8`, although users should not be working directly with the bytes within a string üòÄ. Also, we try to match C semantics here which uses `char *` for strings. There is a plan to perform optimizations on strings for example small string optimizations, so you should never depend on its layout.
