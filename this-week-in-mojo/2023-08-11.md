## Team Answers
### Why not build Mojo on top of Swift?
I'm also a fan of Swift. The major issue with it is that it isn't a member of the Python family. I'm confused why you think that Mojo isn't inspired by Swift, because Mojo certainly is. That said, you're right that building a new thing takes longer than leveraging an existing thing. The reason we're taking this approach is that we're optimizing for quality of result (we want to build the world's best thing) not time to market. I would consider it success if you come to love Mojo more than Swift some day ðŸ˜„
