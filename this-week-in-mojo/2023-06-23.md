# This Week in Mojo 2023-06-23

## Team Answers
### TypeScript
TypeScript is very popular, lots of people use it, and it fits right into the JavaScript ecosystem. Mojo has a similar relationship to Python, it's a superset, it works with the existing ecosystem, and all the packages "just work" which is really important to us because we don't want to break the Python community. However TypeScript doesn't offer any performance improvements, Mojo takes that next step so you can get big speed improvements just by adding types, and gives you access to much lower level features to optimize further.

### Logo and brand community usage
We definitely want the community to be able to use the Mojo logo and name. We should get a proper web page up that describes this.
