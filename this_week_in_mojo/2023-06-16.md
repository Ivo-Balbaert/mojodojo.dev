### Receiver / Free Floating Functions
There are alternative ways to address the same thing, e.g. check out how extensions work in Swift. We'll need to look at this whole area as traits come in. We don't have a goal of providing the Julia multimethod dispatch thing. There isn't an efficient way to implement that other than full monomorphization, it is better to express the same thing with generics, which we haven't designed yet. Let's build out the traits system and see what the limitations are.

### Side Effect Propagation
Unfortunately, it is pretty impractical to define what `side effect free` means in a general purpose language; particularly one that wants you to be able to call existing python code.

In practice side effects would be so common that the model would have to be "add a keyword to opt-in/indicate/require that a function is side effect free", not "add a keyword saying it has side effects".

Given that, very few people would use it, and it would interfere with printf debugging and a lot of other things.

It's possible that there is a model here that will work and would be usable, but I'm not sure how much value it would provide.

### Sorting Algorithm discovered by AlphaDev
Sure, that algorithm could definitely be used inside the Mojo sort algorithm.  What they found is something you'd put into a standard library, e.g. they put it into the libc++ c++ standard library, eventually it could go into the Mojo stdlib.

### StringRef from LLVM
Yep that's where it came from. It is directly related to string_view in C++, the LLVM data structures predate the C++ STL growing all these things. The idea of a `pointer + extend without ownership` is more general than a `reference to a specific owning data structure` because it type erases the concrete storage type. For example, an LLVM StringRef can point into C array, an std::vector, or one of the zoo of other specialized storage types llvm has - it can even point to a scalar on the stack.

Per the comments above, I think actually calling this sort of type `ArrayRef` and `StringRef` in mojo would be super confusing if we have `ref` as a different concept. Python generally uses the word "Slice" for these things, and I think that would be great to use for these.

### `borrowed` keyword
I don't have strong opinions, but I have some concern about general programmers (i.e., those without Rust experience) and the word "borrow". It is a word that can be explained and has good meaning in the rust lexicon, but doesn't connote referencing something, and doesn't even appear in the rust language (they use the & sigil instead). This isn't to say that "borrow" or "borrowed" is bad, but it does have some challenges.
